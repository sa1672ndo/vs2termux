# vs2termux
i dont think this is even vs2termux anymore

anyways goals

- have a main script that installs the mc server, java and possibly glibc
- have folders that contain forge and fabric options and startscripts
- actually have comments this time
- stop the functional programming when its not needed/can be simplified
- a simple mod download script (needs to also be compstible with the poor iSH users waiting for SCL 4.00)
